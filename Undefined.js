var value

//whats the value between this 2 line of variable value?  in JS as you declare a variable there is explicit value assgined / initilalized with UNDEFINED
//What is UNDEFINED?  ---> IT is a JS datatype for example in boolean there is 2 value true or false so in undefined there is only 1 type
// No type information
console.log(value)
