// Declaration and Defined

var value

//whats the value between this 2 line of variable value?  in JS as you declare a variable there is explicit value assgined / initilalized with UNDEFINED
//What is UNDEFINED?  ---> IT is a JS datatype for example in boolean there is 2 value true or false so in undefined there is only 1 type
// No type information
console.log(value)
value = 42;

var x;
if(x == undefined)
console.log("true")
else
console.log("false")


var arr = [1,2,3]
if(arr[3] == undefined)
console.log(true)
else
console.log(false)

//Undefined means  variable has been declaredbut has not been assigned a value
//Null is assignment value It can be representation value of no value
